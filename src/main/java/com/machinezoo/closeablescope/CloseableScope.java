 * This interface could be named UncheckedCloseable, which would be more explicit,

 * without having to define public implementing class every time.
 * After all, when there is an implementing class, then exception specification can be removed on that class
 * and there would then be no need for this interface.
 * So we want some nice interface name that can be part of APIs and UncheckedCloseable doesn't look nice.
 * It's too focused on a technicality. Since this interface would be returned most often
 * when try-with-resources is (ab)used as a scoping mechanism, we will name it CloseableScope.
